# Analysis of Letter Frequency

Using  **HDFS**  and  **MapReduce**  to  calculate  average  letter  frequencies  across  a number  of  languages using  the  books  that  are  available  in  [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/ "Project Gutenberg").

### Assumptions

All files downloaded from the website [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/ "Project Gutenberg") and are in Plain Text UTF-8 format.

All files must be named using its language as prefix and we assume that all books from the same language must have the same prefix plus "-".

Example:

- en-book1.txt
- en-book2.txt
- it-book1.txt
- pt-book1.txt â€¦

__Software version__

- JavaSE 1.7
- Hadoop Virtual Machine (VM) - Ubuntu 64-bit
- Hadoop MapReduce 2.2.0
- Oracle VirtualBox 6.1
- Eclipse IDE - Version: 2020-12 (4.18.0)

### Dataset

For this project I am using 6 books from English, Portuguese and Italian.

- [Journal of Small Things by Helen Mackay][1]
- [Il perduto amore by Umberto Fracchia][2]
- [Memorias Posthumas de Braz Cubas by Machado de Assis][3]
- [Five Little Friends by Sherred Willcox Adams][4]
- [Orlando innamorato by Matteo Maria Boiardo][5]
- [Dom Casmurro by Machado de Assis][6]

__Loading data into HDFS__

```shell
hadoop fs -mkdir /books
hadoop fs -put ./sf_VM-Shared-Folder/books/ /books
```

This is the Output file that had been generated by the MapReduce program:

In order to work on the result just get the file from the HDFS making a copy to your Local Machine using this command:

```shell
hadoop fs -copyToLocal /user/soc/output/part-r-00000 ./sf_VM-Shared-Folder/frequency-letter.txt
```

### Plotting the results

Here is the final analyses comparing the 3 languages:
